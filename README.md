We need to be able to easily group and segment records, like Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Leads or other business data. Dynamics 365 provides several different mechanisms that all have their usage areas. However, there is a need to be able to quickly group records, in a way that is suitable for both individual and organizational usage.

Skyvekraft Thrusted Tags leverages the built-in Connections technology in Dynamics 365, adding a powerful and user-friendly user interface.

Thrusted Tags has built-in life-cycle management capabilities such as Tag Ownership, Scope, Tag Groups, and Duplication Handling. Icons and pictures can be used for easy visual identification, and it supports bulk tagging.

Easier segmentation capabilities provides not only benefits for individual users, it also increases the value of the data in the organizations Dynamics 365 solution.
